# Graph_Theory_Project2023

  This repository is a assingment for my Graph Theory course.  The goal
is to demonstrate my understanding of the Graph Isomorphism Problem
and show some of the research I had to do.
In a few words the Graph Isomorphism Problem is the inability to compare
two graphs and check if they are the same in a polynomial time.

  It consists of a Jupyter notebook called graph_isomorphism.  In this 
notebook all my work is done.  The format of my notebook is in Markdown
and Python language.


How to run this program:

1. Clone this repository onto your computer using git clone "https://github.com/jcoolbeing/Graph_Theory_Project2023"

2. Open a terminal (cmd or windows terminal)

3. Change directory to the cloned folder from github by entering "cd" and the address of folder.

4. Type "jupyter notebook" into terminal and a page will load on your browser.

5. Select the notebook "graph_isomorphism" and you have access to it.
